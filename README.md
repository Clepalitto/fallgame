# Contributing on **Fallgame**

Everybody is welcome to contribute on this little project, from beginners to Software ingeneers !

So here is a todo-list of stuff I don't have the skills to add to the game but would be cool to have : 
* A desktop/mobile app
* some 3D
* New features, such as 
   - A `pause` button
   - Some music
